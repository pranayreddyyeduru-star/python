# 1) Create a list `L` with some integer values and print it 
# as the original list.

# 2) Initialize a variable `count = 0` to store the sum 
# of all elements in the list.

# 3) Use a `for` loop to iterate through each element 
# `i` in the list `L`:

# a) Add each element to `count` using `count += i`.

# 4) Calculate the average of the list:

# a) Divide the total sum `count` by the number of elements `len(L)`.

# b) Store the result in `avg`.

# 5) Print the total sum and the average.

# 6) Sort the list `L` in ascending order using `L.sort()`.

# 7) After sorting:

# a) The smallest element will be at index 0 → print `L[0]`.

# b) The largest element will be at the last index → print `L[-1]`.
